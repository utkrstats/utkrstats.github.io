### Vectors are a type of lego block in R.

```{r}
my_vector <- c(1,1,2,3,5,8) # using the concatenate "c()" operator

cartoons <- c("Spongebob", "Bugs Bunny", "Peter Griffin")
```

### The colon ":" is useful for generating sequential numbers
```{r}
one_thru_ten <- 1:10
one_thru_ten
```

### You can select particular elements with the "[]" notation
```{r}
cartoons[2] #second element of cartoons

my_vector[4] #fourth element of my_vector
```
