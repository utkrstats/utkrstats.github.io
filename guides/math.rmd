### R is a calculator

```{r}
2 + 2
100 / 7
22/17 + 37/47 + 88/83
```

### You can store values
```{r}
a <- 2 # read this like "a is assigned 2"
a + 2
```

### Parentheses are important for harder math
```{r}
1 + 1^2
(1+1)^2
```

### Always use parentheses if you're not sure
```{r}
(10 + 1) / (7 + (8^2))
```

### R supplies some nice math functions
```{r}
sqrt(9.8696)
sin(1)
cos(12)
log(10) # default base is e
exp(1)
```
